# Movie Rating Prediction: Analyzing Movie Data and Building ML Models

This project focuses on analyzing movie data and building machine learning models to predict movie ratings. The goal is to gain insights into factors influencing movie ratings and develop accurate models that estimate ratings based on various features.

## Data Analysis and Wrangling

The code starts by importing essential libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. It then acquires three datasets: movies, ratings, and users. Each dataset is carefully cleaned, ensuring the data is of high quality.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

To gain insights into the data, we create visualizations using popular libraries like seaborn and matplotlib. We explore the age distribution of users through bar plots and histograms. Additionally, we analyze overall ratings by users and identify top movies by viewership. The relationship between movie, age, occupation, and ratings is also examined using histograms.

## Data Preprocessing

The data is preprocessed by extracting the first 500 records and splitting them into features and labels. Features include movie ID, age, and occupation, while ratings serve as labels. The data is further divided into training and testing datasets, ensuring reliable model evaluation.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated using scikit-learn. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Perceptron, Linear SVC, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are among the models utilized. Each model is trained on the training dataset, and its accuracy on the training data is measured.

## Model Comparison

To identify the most accurate model, the performance of all trained models is compared. Accuracy scores are stored in a DataFrame and sorted in descending order, providing insights into the relative performance of the models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and machine learning in predicting movie ratings. By analyzing historical movie data and leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we gain insights into factors influencing movie ratings. The models built enable accurate estimation of ratings, aiding users and critics in making informed decisions. Understanding user preferences and the impact of different features on ratings contributes to improved movie recommendations and a better understanding of audience sentiments.

Let's bring the power of data and machine learning to the world of movies!
