🎥 Movie Rating Prediction: Analyzing Movie Data and Building ML Models 📊🎬

In this LinkedIn post, I will walk you through a code snippet that performs data analysis and builds machine learning models for movie rating prediction. Let's dive in!

🔍 Data Analysis and Wrangling:
The code starts by importing essential libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. It then proceeds to acquire three datasets: movies, ratings, and users. Each dataset is cleaned by removing any missing values, ensuring high-quality data.

📊 Data Exploration and Visualization:
To gain insights, we create visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib libraries. We visualize the age distribution of users through a bar plot and a histogram. Furthermore, we explore the overall ratings by users using a bar plot. Top movies by viewership rating are visualized to identify popular movies. We also analyze the rating data of a specific user and examine the relationship between movie, age, and occupation with ratings using histograms.

🔧 Data Preprocessing:
Next, we preprocess the data by extracting the first 500 records and splitting them into features and labels. Features include movie ID, age, and occupation, while ratings serve as labels. We further divide the data into training and testing datasets using the train_test_split function, ensuring robust model evaluation.

⚙️ Model Training and Evaluation:
We train multiple machine learning models using scikit-learn library, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Perceptron, Linear SVC, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Each model is trained on the training dataset, and its accuracy score on the training data is computed.

🔍 Model Comparison:
To identify the most accurate model, we compare the performance of all the trained models by storing their accuracy scores in a DataFrame. The DataFrame is then sorted in descending order based on the scores, revealing the models' relative performance.

📈 Conclusion:
This code snippet showcases the power of data analysis and machine learning in predicting movie ratings. By analyzing historical movie data and leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we gain insights into factors influencing movie ratings. The models built enable accurate estimation of ratings, aiding users and critics alike in making informed decisions. Understanding user preferences and the impact of different features on ratings can contribute to improved movie recommendations and better understanding of audience sentiments.
