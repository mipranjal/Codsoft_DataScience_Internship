# DataScience Internship by Codsoft

🎯 This repository contains the projects completed as part of the DataScience Internship program offered by Codsoft. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

## Task 2: Movie Prediction 🎬

This project, showcases the power of data analysis and machine learning in predicting movie ratings. By analyzing historical movie data and leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we gain insights into factors influencing movie ratings. The models built enable accurate estimation of ratings, aiding users and critics alike in making informed decisions. Understanding user preferences and the impact of different features on ratings can contribute to improved movie recommendations and better understanding of audience sentiments.
