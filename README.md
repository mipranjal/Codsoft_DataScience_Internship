# DataScience Internship by Codsoft

🎯 This repository contains the projects completed as part of the DataScience Internship program offered by Codsoft. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

## Task 2: Movie Prediction 🎬

In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict the success of movies based on various features such as genre, budget, cast, and more. By analyzing historical movie data, we can provide insights into which factors contribute to a movie's success and make predictions for future films.

## Task 4: Sales Prediction 📈

The goal of this project is to predict sales for a retail company based on historical sales data, advertising budgets, and other relevant features. By training a machine learning model on the provided dataset, we can forecast future sales and help businesses optimize their marketing strategies.

## Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection 🔒

In this project, we tackle the critical issue of credit card fraud by developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. By analyzing patterns and anomalies in credit card data, we can automatically identify potential fraud and take preventive measures. This project aims to provide a robust solution to protect businesses and individuals from financial losses.
